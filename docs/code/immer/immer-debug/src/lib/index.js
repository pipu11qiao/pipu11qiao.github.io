/**
 * The `produce` function takes a value and a "recipe function" (whose
 * return value often depends on the base state). The recipe function is
 * free to mutate its first argument however it wants. All mutations are
 * only ever applied to a __copy__ of the base state.
 *
 * Pass only a function to create a "curried producer" which relieves you
 * from passing the recipe function every time.
 *
 * Only plain objects and arrays are made mutable. All other objects are
 * considered uncopyable.
 *
 * Note: This function is __bound__ to its `Immer` instance.
 *
 * @param {any} base - the initial state
 * @param {Function} producer - function that receives a proxy of the base state as first argument and which can be freely modified
 * @param {Function} patchListener - optional function that will be called with all the patches produced here
 * @returns {any} a new state, or the initial state if nothing was modified
